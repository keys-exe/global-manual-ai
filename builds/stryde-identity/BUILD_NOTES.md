# Build notes — stryde-identity (STRYDE · Identity Callout, Manual)

Read this first when resuming. Build Sheet: `BUILD_SHEET.md` (steps 1–3) · `STEP4_5.md` (steps 4–5) · voice: `voice/VOICE_SOURCE.md`.

## Intake
- **Drive task folder:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tKlZFjNApDMf5U_q3qFPcRyGZLQsVcwE
  ("C - VID | AI VO | TOF | Identity Callout | New | A Must For V2"). No OUTPUT subfolders exist in it.
- The same folder was also run earlier as `identity-callout-v2` (Automatic, 2026-09-25, branch
  `claude/vigilant-archimedes-c5sh8z`). **stryde-identity is the live build** (Manual, 2026-09-26).
- **Board:** https://claude.ai/artifact/GKZDjmZkh4wwm7RxtXj7Tp

## Sessions
- session_01…(eloquent-darwin, 2026-09-26 08:00–09:17): steps 1–5, avatars (recast N and Pat on the user's call),
  six plates (all USE), narrator §22U steps 1–5 (G1–G3 USE, gate max 5.1%, 41.27s clone source).
- session_019jyz29Da9tQzhkoLnhKTSF (2026-09-26 09:20, resume): merged that work onto `main`'s board work;
  re-downloaded G1–G3 from Kling (links expire ~2026-09-27 09:10 UTC) and rebuilt `Identity_clone_source.mp3`
  with `voice_source.py` — identical figures; created the board and loaded 16 cards (5 cast confirmed,
  6 plates + 3 voice takes + clone source in review); moved the hourly Fix check here (`trig_01AkAtMoRj4zmTuGSkTRApUw`).

## Where it stands
- **Stopped at §22U step 6 (HUMAN in Manual):** the user clones `Identity_clone_source` in ElevenLabs
  (Instant Voice Clone, Remove background noise ON, name `Identity`) and sends the voice ID.
  The file is on the board (card VO-N-SRC, MP3 stream in an MP4 container, not re-encoded). Media is git-ignored.
- Then: step 7–9 TTS (verbatim script lines, `tts_budget.py --script-lines`), step 10 master listen (user),
  then E6 durations for every B-roll row, then step 6 hooks one by one (HK1–HK3, split layout EG01).
- Open flags from the Build Sheet: F2 (Pat's cropped trousers vs strap visibility), F4 (comparative claim P-005),
  F7 (`package_closed.jpg` missing), F8 (AVATAR-SHEET doc inconsistency), F10 (watermark omit).
